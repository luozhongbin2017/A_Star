# A* Path Finder

Implementation of the A* path finding algorithm from scratch using python.

# Usage

### Creating a map
* Modify `self.grid` in the `A_Star` class in `a_star.py`
* Higher numbers = higher cost to move traverse that cell, and vice-versa
* Lowest allowable cost is 1

### Running
* Run `python3 a_star.py` from terminal

# Dependencies

* For fancy graphics, `grarphics.py` must be installed
